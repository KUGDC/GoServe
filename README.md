GoServe
=======

Goofing around with a simple golang server and GLUT. Right now it's just a
simple graphical demo that I'm hoping to evolve into a cool server/client
simulation.

Installation
============

On Ubuntu based computer (should be very similar on Debian/Mint)

+ sudo apt-get install golang libglew-dev freeglut3-dev
+ Setup your gopath, etc as descibed [here](http://golang.org/doc/code.html)
+ run `go get -u github.com/KUGDC/GoServe`
+ cd to the src directory in your go path, then github.com/KUGDC/GoServe
+ go run simple.go
